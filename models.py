        #I can have the same block used for both of those, and have that be the training
        #so for the experience replay, I pass in the state with noise, and the is_valid 
        #for the first one is known and doesnt have to be calculated.
        #now one obvious issue with this is that if we keep seeing the same state over and
        #over again it will overfit. also, it will more likely learn the difference between
        #real and fake states, since one is the true input data and the other is imagined data
        #now that isn't necessarily bad, we could probably train the net so that it somehow
        #generates realistic transitions. i.e. we consider the imagined state a generator
        #and the is valid a discriminator, and since we receive 50/50 we will see whether
        #it learns to create more realistic representations. I would need to research gan
        #losses to do that. 
        #for now what I have where I will manually mix the valid / invalid is fine

        #now instead of doing batch training like I am doing right now, I could also have
        #a head which predicts whether or not to do another simulation
        #the value of that simulation could determine whether or not to continue
        #i.e. the value*chance that we should continue
        
        #the issue with this is I can't think of a good way to determine whether to continue
        # or to not. also, right now the second part of the head only takes one 
        # state, so that wouldn't really work. although I think maybe we could concat
        # it on the batch dimension and run it like that. 
        # 
        # It is an interesting idea worth exploring, since basically the net could actively
        # learn how much it wants to think about a state, but for now what I have works 

        #so lets see, the first part takes a state and noise and creates a valid state
        #with that valid state the second part takes the original input, the imagined state
        #and guess the value of the original state, and a policy for the original state
        #the effect the policy will have on the averaging will depend on it's confidence 
        #with the validity and the value
        #so policies with a high value will get more weight and policies with a low validity
        #confidence will get low weight.
        #maybe I can do an average of the two
        #the only thing I really care about averaging is the policy, the rest I will just
        #do supervised learning on. 

        #REMINDER: we want to balance the number of valid states so that the system doesnt get skewed one way or the other. maybe something like that for value too
        
        
        #so okay, what I need to do is have a gan-like setup where the valid input will
        #randomly either receive a real input or an imagined input, and it needs to 
        #be able to discriminate between them. so in 
        # if np.random.uniform() > .5:
        #     valid_inp = residual


        #so a natural question is if we arent doing parameter sharing we could probably
        #just put every in one big block
        #, the difference is I want...
        #this is okay for now. try it out
